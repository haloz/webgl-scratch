webgl-scratch
=============

This is a little repository of mine for JavaScript based WebGL development. I planned this as a little project to develop a WebGL Cover Flow for products in an ecommerce shop.

Todos
=============
* get DOM ready event handling into requireJS loader instead of extra jQuery document ready
* setup test driven development (Karma? Jasmine? JUnit?)
* update to latest jQuery (Git!)
* update to latest RequireJS (Git!)
* unify all external dependencies via Git
